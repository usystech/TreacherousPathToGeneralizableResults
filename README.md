# TreacherousPathToGeneralizableResults
My research thesis from Rutgers, including R code for replicating simulations performed in thesis. The paper examines how treatment effect pervasiveness (the proportion of observations in a data set that exhibit an effect) can skew hallmark statistics such as SDs, t- and F-tests, and effect size measurements. The real world implications of this phenomenon are both pervasive and significant to the conclusions researchers can draw from their analyses.

The R code titles match up with the simulations named in the research, e.g. Simulation 1 code pertains to the simulation described in the first simulation of the paper. 

The Pervasiveness statistic code was a preliminary attempt, based on theoretical assumptions, to measure treatment effect pervasiveness in a sample. The results, while underwhelming, have spurned further attempts to measure this elusive attribute. Further code will attempt to use a Gaussian mixture-model approach, using expectation maximization, to estimate pervasivness. Keep an eye out for future code drops.
